    "1. In the control flow example where we calculate the derivative of `d` with respect to `a`, what would happen if we changed the variable `a` to a random vector or a matrix? At this point, the result of the calculation `f(a)` is no longer a scalar. What happens to the result? How do we analyze this?\n",
    "1. Let $f(x) = \\sin(x)$. Plot the graph of $f$ and of its derivative $f'$. Do not exploit the fact that $f'(x) = \\cos(x)$ but rather use automatic differentiation to get the result. \n",
    "1. Let $f(x) = ((\\log x^2) \\cdot \\sin x) + x^{-1}$. Write out a dependency graph tracing results from $x$ to $f(x)$. \n",
    "1. Use the chain rule to compute the derivative $\\frac{df}{dx}$ of the aforementioned function, placing each term on the dependency graph that you constructed previously. \n",
    "1. Given the graph and the intermediate derivative results, you have a number of options when computing the gradient. Evaluate the result once starting from $x$ to $f$ and once from $f$ tracing back to $x$. The path from $x$ to $f$ is commonly known as *forward differentiation*, whereas the path from $f$ to $x$ is known as backward differentiation. \n",
    "1. When might you want to use forward differentiation and when backward differentiation? Hint: consider the amount of intermediate data needed, the ability to parallelize steps, and the size of matrices and vectors involved.\n"
